                The term &ldquo;404 Not Found&ldquo; was coined by Berners-Lee
                himself, who explained in a 1998 interview that he wanted to
                make the error message &ldquo;slightly apologetic&ldquo;. He
                also said that he considered using &ldquo;400 Bad Request&ldquo;
                instead, but decided that it was too vague and technical.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first documented case of a 404 error appearing on a web page
                was in 1993, when a user tried to access a page about the Mosaic
                web browser on the NCSA website. The page had been moved to a
                different location, but the link had not been updated. The user
                reported the error to the NCSA team, who fixed the link and
                added a humorous message to their 404 page: &ldquo;We&apos;re
                sorry, but the document you requested is not here. Maybe you
                should try someplace else.&ldquo;
              </p>
              <p>
                Since then, 404 errors have become one of the most common and
                recognizable errors on the Web. Many websites have customized
                their 404 pages with creative designs, messages, or features to
                entertain or assist their visitors. For example, Google&apos;s
                404 page features a broken robot and a link to its homepage,
                while GitHub&apos;s 404 page shows a random image of a parallax
                star field and a link to its status page. Some websites have
                also used their 404 pages to showcase their brand personality,
                humor, or social causes. For instance, Lego&apos;s 404 page
                shows the Lego minifigure Emmet along with a humorous message,
                Amazon&apos;s displays the image of a dog, Peugeot&apos;s shows
                a picture of its 404 model, and RTÃ‰&apos;s shows an image of
                Bosco.
